Made the workflow script [gitworkflow_script] by ripping it line for line from chatGPT.
Then I made it executable with the command "chmod +x 'file/path'".

Then I went into the ~/bashrc file and added the following line at the end:
alias gwf='~/Desktop/ducky/gitworkflow_script'

This alias now works everytime I use it, even in newly opened terminals!
